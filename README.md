- Advanced Error Handling: Gracefully handles invalid URLs and connection issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- Backend: Python with Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Text Processing: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Content Extraction: BeautifulSoup, Requests
- Algorithms: TextRank (based on Google's PageRank)
- Containerization: Docker

## üîß Installation
<b>Using Docker (Recommended)</b>
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tldr-summarizer.git
cd tldr-summarizer

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t tldr-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 tldr-app
```

<b>Manual Installation</b>
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tldr-summarizer.git
cd tldr-summarizer

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download NLTK data
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords')"

# Run the application
python main.py
```
<i>Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser to use the application.</i>

## üìã Usage
1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Paste any article URL into the input field
3. Click "Summarize"
4. Read the generated summary

## üß† How It Works
TL;DR uses a sophisticated pipeline to generate high-quality summaries:

1. URL Validation: Ensures the provided URL is valid and accessible
2. Content Extraction: Uses domain-specific extractors to identify the main article content
3. Text Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes the extracted text
4. TextRank Algorithm: Builds a sentence similarity matrix and ranks sentences by importance
5. Adaptive Summarization: Selects the optimal number of sentences based on article length
6. Title Integration: Ensures the summary includes information relevant to the article title
7. Formatting: Arranges the summary into readable paragraphs
